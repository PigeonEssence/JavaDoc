This program based on SSM Framework set；
SSM（Spring+SpringMVC+MyBatis） is a Framework set, agglomerated Spring，SpringMVC，and MyBatis.
spring:
  powerful on IoC and AoP:
    In this program we can see Spring is a factory of bean,and foucous on IoC 
    Central to the Spring Framework is its inversion of control (IoC) container this powerful fuction based on reflect in JAVA, 
user no need to control the life cycle of Object in program by dependency injection, the beanfactory control. This way reduced coupling and programmer
can spend much more time focous on oter powerful function.

SpringMVC:
  spring mvc is useing by develop Web program, easy to test(by annotations);
  spring mvc is highly configurable, we useing this function to achieve Scan package path,Release static resource,File upload parser,
and Configuring interceptors.
  
MyBatis:
  MyBatis is a first class persistence framework with support for custom SQL,
  MyBatis eliminates almost all of the JDBC code and manual setting of parameters and retrieval of results.  
  MyBatis can use simple XML or Annotations for configuration and map primitives, 
  Map interfaces and Java POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) to database records. (from: https://mybatis.org/mybatis-3/index.html)
 which means programmer no need to write SQL in JS file orother file, MyBatis can easy useing XML file to write SQL sentence and reduce the coupling
  
So all for me, the SSM Framework set is use for reduce the coupling and Increase development efficiency.
